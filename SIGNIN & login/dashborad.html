            Apple could be putting an Action button on your next iPhone. According to a July report from MacRumors, code
            in the fourth iOS 17 developer beta hints at functionality for an Action button on the next-gen iPhone 15
            Pro and Pro Max models.
            Apple introduced the Action button on the Apple Watch Ultra. It's a physical button on the side of the Apple
            Watch Ultra that allows you to run a preselected function or program when you press it without unlocking
            your device or navigating to an app. Some of the preselected functions include starting a stopwatch,
            beginning a workout and turning on your flashlight.

           JavaScript is a single-threaded language, built to handle tasks one at a
            time. However, the event loop lets JavaScript handle events and callbacks asynchronously by emulating
            simultaneous programming systems. This assures the performance of your JavaScript applications. JavaScript
